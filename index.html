                Hello, my name is Mohammed Gayazuddin, and I am a developer with a passion for cutting-edge 
                technologies like robotics, machine learning, and computer graphics.  I have a strong foundation 
                in mathematics and enjoy applying mathematical concepts to solve complex problems. I am always eager 
                to push the boundaries of what is possible and to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive 
                impact on the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my work as a developer, I have experience with programming languages such as Python, Java, and 
                C++, as well as frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning applications. 
                I also have a deep understanding of mathematical concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, and 
                probability theory, which are crucial in many areas of computer science. I have also worked with a 
                range of tools and technologies for computer graphics, including Blender, Unity, and OpenGL.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my professional work, I enjoy staying up to date on the latest developments in 
                robotics and AI through reading and attending conferences and workshops. I am particularly interested 
                in exploring how these technologies can be used to solve real-world problems and improve people's 
                lives.

                    The project aims to create a robot capable of performing tasks and navigating a dynamic 
                    environment without human intervention. The robot is equipped with sensors and software using 
                    ROS2 to handle input, perform real-time control.
