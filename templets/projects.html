            I have developed several projects that showcase my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. 
            These include:

        <div class="project-1">
            <h4 class = "title">Autonomous Robot</h4>
            <p class = "discription">
                The project aims to create a robot capable of performing tasks and navigating a dynamic 
                environment without human intervention. The robot is equipped with sensors and software using 
                ROS2 to handle input, perform real-time control.
            </p>
        </div>
          
        <div class="project-2">
            <h4 class = "title">Face Identification and Attendance Management System</h4>
            <p class = "discription">
                A face identification and attendance management system, created using Flask and 
                Convolutional Neural Network, which can accurately identify students and 
                mark attendance.
            </p>
        </div>
          
        <div class="project-3">
            <h4 class = "title">Diabetes Progression</h4>
            <p class = "discription">
                I build a multivariate linear regression model from scratch using the 
                sci-kit-learn library that predicts a quantitative measure of disease 
                progression one year after baseline for diabetes patients.
            </p>
        </div>
          
        <div class="project-4">
            <h4 class = "title">Workout Tracker</h4>
            <p class = "discription">
                Using the Nutritionix API, Sheety API, and Python I created a workout 
                tracker that converts a natural language input into activity duration and 
                calories burned, which are then stored in an Excel sheet using Sheety API.
            </p>
        </div>
          
        <div class="project-5">
            <h4 class = "title">Stock Price Alert</h4>
            <p class = "discription">
                I built an application in Python that compares the stock prices of a stock form 
                previous days and alerts the user of the percentage change in price along with 
                the top 3 news articles of that company, utilizing the SMTPLIB and stock API.

        <div class="project-6">
            <h4 class = "title">Sudoku Solver</h4>
            <p class = "discription">
                With the help of Back tracking algorithm, I wrote an program in Python that solve 
                any Sudoku problem. 
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p class = "outer-dicsription">
            These projects demonstrate my proficiency in software development and my ability to 
            apply technical knowledge to solve real-world problems.
